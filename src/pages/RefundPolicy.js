        At AI Girl Chat, we strive to provide a high-quality subscription service. We understand that sometimes things might not meet your expectations, and we want to clarify our refund process below.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Eligibility for Refund</h2>
      <p className="mb-6">
        You may request a full refund within <strong>5 minutes</strong> of your payment, provided that the AI chat service has not been excessively used or abused during that time. Refund requests made after this period are generally not eligible, as the service is digital and consumed immediately.
